# HikerHub - Trekking Management System

**HikerHub** is a web application that helps manage trekking activities. It allows users to book treks, agencies to organize trips, guides to manage assigned treks, and participants to track their bookings. The system brings all these features together in one place, making trek management easier and more organized.

## Key Features

### Admin Suite
- **Global Overview Dashboard**: Quick-glance metrics for total treks, registered trekkers, active staff, and overall bookings.
- **Trek Route Builder**: Add, review, approve, and delete trek events, detailing route length, maximum altitude, and required safety equipment.
- **Staff Assignment Matrix**: Assign approved guides/staff members to specific routes.
- **Chronological Classifications & Sorting**: Treks are automatically categorized into **Past**, **Active**, or **Future** schedules and sorted with the newest/future treks first.
- **User Directory**: View, approve new guide registrations, and whitelist or blacklist/deactivate users & staff members with verification checks.
- **Staff Promotion**: Promote active guides to Administrator status directly.
- **Search Engine**: Search treks and users by names, email addresses, or IDs.
- **Booking Filtering**: Filter bookings by status, trek, or date.

### Trek Staff Portal
- **My Expeditions**: Dashboard listing assigned treks, departure dates, capacity status, and participant headcounts.
- **Trekkers Log**: View contact cards and registration details of participants booked on assigned treks.
- **Capacity Management**: Adjust remaining available slots and toggle trek status (`Pending`, `Approved`, `Open`, `Closed`, `Completed`) with robust capacity validation guards. Staff cannot transition treks back to admin-controlled pending/approved states.

### Trekker (User) Experience

- **Booking Cancellation**: Self-cancel bookings before the trek start date.
- **Profile Customizer**: Update personal details and contact numbers.
