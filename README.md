## 🔐 Authentication & Validation Highlights

* **Frosted-Glass Redesign**: The login (`/login`) and unified registration (`/register`) pages utilize a full-screen, responsive lock-viewport structure with a backdrop blur overlay on a majestic Himalayan mountain base layer.
* **Segmented CSS Role Slider**: The registration page features a pure-CSS sliding switch using radio buttons to select between **Trekker 🏕️** and **Trek Staff 🏔️** with zero JavaScript dependencies.
* **Password Match Checks**: Requires entering matching values in both `Password` and `Confirm Password` fields.
* **Indian Phone Validation**: Limits contact details to Indian numbers starting with country code `+91` followed by exactly 10 digits (validated via HTML5 pattern matching and regex backend checks).
